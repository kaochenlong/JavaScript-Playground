### Packages

- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) for assets bundling

### Usage

Just copy and paste following commands in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/kaochenlong/JavaScript-Playground.git

or just run `npx scaffold-html PROJECT_NAME`, then it will create a sample project for you on the fly :)

After installing those packages, `cd` into the project folder and run `yarn dev` and then everything should be ready to go!
